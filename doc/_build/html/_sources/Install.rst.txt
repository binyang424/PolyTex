Clean
=====

To clean everything (thus getting the same tree as in the repository):

.. code:: 

   $ ./setup.py clean

You can also clean things with git using:

.. code:: 

   $ git clean -Xdf

which will clear everything ignored by ``.gitignore``, and:

.. code:: 

   $ git clean -df

to clear all untracked files. You can revert the most recent changes in
git with:

.. code:: 

   $ git reset --hard

WARNING: The above commands will all clear changes you may have made,
and you will lose them forever. Be sure to check things with
``git status``, ``git diff``, ``git clean -Xn``, and ``git clean -n``
before doing any of those.

Bugs
====

Our issue tracker is at
https://github.com/PolyKriging/PolyKriging/issues. Please report any
bugs that you find. Or, even better, fork the repository on GitHub and
create a pull request. We welcome all changes, big or small, and we will
help you make the pull request if you are new to git (just ask on our
mailing list or Gitter Channel).
