Tow class example
=================
This example shows how to use the Tow class in PolyTex package. It is designed to handle the parametrization and geometrical analysis of a fiber tow. A Tow instance is created by passing the point cloud of a tow, which consists only the points on the tow surface, to the constructor.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 8-10

Example dataset
---------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-17

.. code-block:: default

    import polytex as pk
    import numpy as np

    # Load the surface points of fiber tow
    path = pk.example("surface points")
    surf_points = pk.pk_load(path).to_numpy()


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 18-20

We clip the coordinates to discard the part of the tow that is necessary for
the modeling of the tow. Optional.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 20-23

.. code-block:: default

    mask = (surf_points[:, 0] > 1.1 - 0.2) & (surf_points[:, 0] < 11.55 + 0.2)
    surf_points_clip = surf_points[mask]


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-29

Exchange the first and last column for geometry analysis. Note that
the last column is deemed as the label column. Namely, the points
with the same label are considered as belonging to the same slice and
are parametrized in the radial direction (theta). This data reorder
is necessary for the users.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-31

.. code-block:: default

    coordinates = surf_points_clip[:, [2, 1, 0]]


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-35

We can filtering the points to remove noise or the points that are not necessary:
mask = abs(coordinates[:, -1] - 9.196) > 0.09
coordinates = coordinates[mask]

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 37-39

Create a Tow instance with PolyTex Tow class
--------------------------------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 39-41

.. code-block:: default

    tow = pk.Tow(surf_points=coordinates, tex=0, name="binder_4", order="zyx")


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-46

Get the parametric coordinates of the tow: The points on the same slice
are parametrized in the radial direction (theta) and stored in the
normalized distance column of the attribute, tow.coordinates, a pandas
DataFrame.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 46-48

.. code-block:: default

    df_coord = tow.coordinates  # parametric coordinates of the tow


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 49-55

Get the geometrical features of the tow: The geometrical features of the tow
are stored in the attribute, tow.geom_features, a pandas DataFrame.
For straight fiber tows, the geometrical features can be used as an approximation
of the actual tow geometry. But for wavy tows, such as binder, the geometrical
features are not accurate enough. We need to redo the geometrical analysis
after identifying the normal cross-sections of the tow.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 55-57

.. code-block:: default

    df_geom = tow.geom_features  # geometrical features of the tow


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-63

Resampling
----------
Resampling the control points of the tow with a uniform spacing in the
normalized distance direction. The resampling is necessary to create a
parametric representation based on dual kriging.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-69

.. code-block:: default

    theta_res = 35  # number of control points in the radial direction
    sample_position = np.linspace(0, 1, theta_res, endpoint=True)  # equal spaced points (normalized distance)
    pts_krig, expr_krig = tow.resampling(krig_config=("lin", "cub"),
                                         skip=2, sample_position=sample_position,
                                         smooth=0.0001)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-74

Save and reload the tow instance
--------------------------------
tow.save("./tow/binder_4.tow")
tow = np.load("./tow/binder_4.tow", allow_pickle=True).tolist()

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 76-78

Plot the tow
------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-80

.. code-block:: default

    mesh = tow.surf_mesh(plot=True, save_path="./test_data/binder_4.ply", end_closed=True)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 81-83

Smooth the tow trajectory with Kriging
--------------------------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 83-86

.. code-block:: default

    trajectory_sm = tow.trajectory(smooth=0.0015, plot=False,
                                   save_path="./test_data/trajectory.ply", orientation=True)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 87-91

Axial and radial lines
----------------------
Get the axial lines of the tow (the lines connecting the parametrized control points in
the axial direction)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-97

.. code-block:: default

    line_axi = tow.axial_lines(plot=True)

    # Get the radial lines of the tow (the lines connecting the parametrized control points in
    # the radial direction)
    line_rad = tow.radial_lines(plot=True)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 98-104

Get the normal cross-sections of the tow
----------------------------------------
So far, we provide two methods to get the normal cross-sections of the tow.
The first method wraps the intersection function of plane and surface mesh
in the pyvista package. The second method is based on the intersection of
a parametric curve and a implicit plane.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 104-105

.. code-block:: default

    cross_section, plane = tow.normal_cross_section(algorithm="pyvista")

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 106-113

Update the geometrical features of the tow
------------------------------------------
The geometrical features of the tow are stored in the attribute, tow.geom_features, a pandas DataFrame.
You have this information once the tow instance is created. However, that is calculated based on the vertical
cross-sections of the tow. A more accurate geometrical analysis can be done during the identification of
the normal cross-sections with the class method, Tow.normal_cross_section.
Hard copy to prevent the modification by the kriging method.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 113-118

.. code-block:: default

    df_geom_pv = tow.geom_features.copy()

    cross_section, plane = tow.normal_cross_section(algorithm="kriging")
    df_geom_krig = tow.geom_features


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 119-127

Geometry features
-----------------
as shwon above, the tow geometry features can be updated after the normal cross-sections
are identified using both method. However, the accuracy are different. The pyvista method
is faster but less accurate. In the kriging method, we transform the identified cross-sections
to a 2d plane. The geometry features are then calculated based on the 2d coordinates. Thus, the
geometry features are more accurate than the pyvista method. However, this also makes the
kriging method less efficient. The kriging method is recommended for wavy tows, such as binder.
